When simulating there should be folders for all initial velocities, named in the following style: V0_x where x is the initial velocity in km/t
These initial velocity folders need to be placed inside the "VelocityGraph" folder.

All PNG's and the "Edited photos" folder can be deleted if wanted. 
The current PNG's are the result of my simulation used in the master thesis: "Hill ascent confidence model and simulator for trailer trucks"
