For the simulation to work the content of the "UnZIP_AndMoveHere" folder needs to be unziped and moved into the main project.

When simulating there should be folders for all initial velocities, named in the following style: V0_x where x is the initial velocity in km/t
These initial velocity folders need to be placed inside the "VelocityGraph" folder.

All PNG's and the "Edited photos" folder can be deleted if wanted.
